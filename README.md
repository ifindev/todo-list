# Simple Todo List App Created using CRA

This is a simple Todo list App created using `create-react-app`. You can add a todo item, but for now you cannot delete it or mark a todo item as done. I will work on that later. Also, this todo list is designed to be responsive. So you can open it on your mobile, tablet, or desktop. Currently, all data is stored in state. So a browser refresh will definitely reset todo list to its' original data. 

Have fun!
